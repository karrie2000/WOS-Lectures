# Variables and Data Types

There are two families of data types:
- Primitive (strings, numbers, booleans, symbols, undefined, null)
- Reference (arrays, objects, functions)

```js
let myNum = 0;
myNum = 2;
```

```js
let myArr = [1, 2, 3]
```

Behind the scenes, primitive data types are immutable - they cannot change.

Every primitive data type has a corresponding object wrapper type.
